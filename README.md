## Note-App

```
As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20
characters
So I can find the one I want

As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember

As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
So I can see all the information in the note
